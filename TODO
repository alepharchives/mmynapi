Add a generic fault message body type that is returned when an exception is encountered.

An exception is defined as any situation that occurs during processing that prevents the
requested message type to start processing. Examples are:

1. Wrong message vsn in header
2. invalid types in header
3. Missing mandatory fields in messages
4. Server exceptions thrown during processing.

The only time a valid response is received from a message is when that routine has been
processed and the response is as a direct result of processing that message. Any other
situation that arises, is considered an exception
